* Alpha compositing
  + Porter-Duff
  + Premultiplied vs separated alpha

$$ r = r_0 + (r_1 - r_0) \cdot \alpha_1 $$

* Clipping and soft masking
* Maybe affine transformation belongs here?
* Blend modes

[Alpha Compositing] is a very in-depth, interactive exposition by the legendary Bartosz Ciechanowski.
