* [Colour Appearance Issues in Digital Video, HD/UHD, and Dâ€‘cinema](https://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf). This is Poynton's 2018 PhD, with very rich information on modern digital video formats.

* [color vision](https://handprint.com/LS/CVS/color.html). A comprehensive resource, arguably the best on the web.

* The [Wikipedia article on sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) is ok and links to other resources.
