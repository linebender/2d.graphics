This is a dream of a book I would really like to write, covering at least the basics of most topics in 2D graphics. There are many excellent textbooks for 3D graphics, and cources are widely taught, but there's really nothing comprehensive for 2D out there.

It's very difficult to find enough time as it is, much less adding writing a book, but I'm hoping I will have bursts of energy, especially as I dig deep into one topic or other. I also use this repo to collect references to high quality resources, and that alone is something that may be helpful to some people.

This project is open source, and pull requests and issues are welcome. Just head to the [github repo](https://github.com/linebender/2d.graphics).

And if you'd like to take a look at what's here, go through to the [contents.](/book/contents.html)
